## MongoDB for .NET Training: Single Instance

### Basics of Single Instance

A single instance MongoDB installation refers to the configuration and operation of a single MongoDB database instance on a server. This configuration is the easiest and fastest way to get MongoDB up and running and is well suited for development environments, testing and simple use cases where high availability and scalability are not critical.

#### Features of a single instance

- **Simplicity**: A single MongoDB instance is easy to install, configure and manage.
- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: Since there is only one instance, the database is not fault tolerant and failure of the server will result in loss of data access.
- **Limited scalability**: All data and requests are handled by a single server, which limits scalability.

#### Areas of application

-  Development and test environments**: Quick to set up and ideal for testing applications.
- **Small applications**: Suitable for applications with low data volumes and few simultaneous accesses.

### Advantages and disadvantages compared to other models

#### Advantages

1. **Easy installation and configuration**
   - The installation process for a single MongoDB instance is straightforward and requires only minimal configuration adjustments.
   - Example: Starting an instance with the `mongod` command and default configuration.

2 **Low cost**
   - No need for additional hardware or complex network infrastructure.
   - Ideal for low-cost setups and proof-of-concept projects.

3 **Simple management**
   - Fewer components to monitor and manage.
   - No replication or sharding configuration required.

#### Disadvantages

3 **Simple management**
   - Fewer components to monitor and manage.
   - No replication or sharding configuration required.

#### Disadvantages

1 **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**
   - Failure of the instance leads to complete data loss and interruption of data access.
   - No failover mechanism available.

2 **Limited scalability**
   - Performance and capacity are limited to the resources of the individual server.
   - Can quickly reach its limits with high loads or large amounts of data.

3 **No high availability**
   - In the event of a server failure, the database is not available.
   - No automatic data recovery or redundancy.

### Example: Installation and operation of a single instance

#### Installation

**Windows**

1. download **MongoDB Community Server**: Download from the official MongoDB website and run the MSI installer.
2. perform **installation**: Follow the instructions in the installation wizard and select the default options.
3 **Start MongoDB service**: Start the MongoDB service via the service administration (`services.msc`).

**Linux (Ubuntu)**

1 **Add repository**:
    ```sh
    wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    echo “deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse” | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.4.list
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
2. **Installation**:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
    ```
3. **Start MongoDB service**:
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl start mongod
    sudo systemctl enable mongod
    ```

#### Operation

1 **Configuration**: Adjust the configuration file (`mongod.conf` on Linux or `mongod.cfg` on Windows) if necessary (e.g. data directory, port, authentication).
2 **Start the MongoDB server**:
    ```sh
    mongod --config /path/to/mongod.conf
    ```
3. establish **connection**: Use the MongoDB shell to connect to the instance and execute initial commands:
    ```sh
    mongo
    ```

### Conclusion

A single instance MongoDB configuration is ideal for development environments and small applications where simplicity and cost efficiency are key. However, for production environments with high availability and scalability requirements, replica sets or sharding should be considered.
