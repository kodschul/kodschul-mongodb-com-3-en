# MongoDB for .NET: Introduction to Replica Sets

## Introduction to replica sets and their importance

Replica sets are an essential feature of MongoDB that ensures high availability and redundancy for your database. A replica set consists of multiple MongoDB instances that replicate data to ensure resilience and data integrity.

### Importance of replica sets

- **High availability**: In the event of an instance failure, another instance automatically takes over the role of the primary node.
- **Data redundancy**: Data is replicated to multiple nodes, preventing data loss.
-  Read scaling**: Secondary nodes can be used for read requests to reduce the load on the primary node.

## Important terms and concepts

- **Primary**: The node that receives all write operations. There is always only one primary node in a replica set.
- **Secondary**: Nodes that replicate data from the primary node. These nodes can be used for read operations.
-  Arbiter**: A node that participates in the election of the primary node but does not replicate data. An arbiter is used to ensure an odd number of nodes in a replica set.
- **Election**: The process by which a new primary node is elected when the current primary fails.

## Infrastructure and configuration

### Infrastructure setup and requirements

To set up a replica set, you need at least three MongoDB instances. These can run on physical servers, virtual machines or container-based environments.

- **Minimum**: Three nodes (e.g. two secondary nodes and one arbiter or three replication nodes without arbiter).
-  Recommended**: An odd number of nodes to ensure that a majority can always be achieved.

### Step-by-step configuration of a replica set

#### Prerequisites

- Installed MongoDB instances on all nodes.
- Network connection between the nodes.

#### 1. Start MongoDB on all nodes

Start MongoDB on all nodes with the option to work as a replica set.

```sh
mongod --replSet “rs0” --bind_ip localhost,<node IP>
```
#### 2. Establish a connection to the primary node
Connect to the MongoDB shell on the node you want to initialize as primary.

```sh
mongo --host <primary node IP>
```

#### 3. Initialize Replica Set
Initialize the replica set with the following command:

```js
rs.initiate({
  _id: “rs0”,
  members: [
    { _id: 0, host: “<primary node IP>:27017” },
    { _id: 1, host: “<secondary node1-IP>:27017” },
    { _id: 2, host: “<secondary node2-IP>:27017” }
  ]
});
```

#### 4. Check the status of the replica set
Check the status of the replica set to ensure that all nodes have been added correctly:

```sh
rs.status();
```

#### 5. Customize configuration
If required, add additional configuration options, such as priorities for selecting the primary node or replication delays.

```sh
cfg = rs.conf();
cfg.members[1].priority = 0.5;
cfg.members[2].priority = 0.5;
rs.reconfig(cfg);
```

#### 6. Configure connections in your .NET application
Configure your .NET application so that it connects to the replica set. This is usually done by specifying the connection string in the configuration file or in the code.

```csharp
var connectionString = “mongodb://<primary-node-IP>:27017,<secondary-node1-IP>:27017,<secondary-node2-IP>:27017/?replicaSet=rs0”;
var client = new MongoClient(connectionString);
var database = client.GetDatabase(“your_database_name”);
```
